This is a tool I'll probably never finish designed to make it easier to animate using Minecraft Bedrock UI.
It's goal is to solve two issues with UI animation in Bedrock:
1. You have to reload every time you want to view a change to your animation
2. Animations are chained so instead of a timeline style system, animations are time-since-last-animation which is harder to calculate.

This tool create a keyframe style animator similar to blockbench that lets you live-preview animated elements and generates UI animation JSON.
